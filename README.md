# card-game
6/6/23simple program that lets user play Texas Hold'em.




-before running main file: 

I did not add a checking function or block for incorrect user inputs yet (i forgot must do that asap)

when it asks you to raise or call, just type r for now. i did not add the code for when they want to call (easy add, but have been busy with summer classes)
